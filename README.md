## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
  I have learned about flex box and some new commands in flex . To be precise I have learned about 
  
```css
 
 main{
      flex-direction: column-reverse;
 }
```
This will simply reverse the column order.


### Continued development

I have to concentrate much on responsive part . 



### Useful resources

- [W3 School ](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for figuring out some useful commands for html.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This helped me a lot with my css part particularly for flex box
